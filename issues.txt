Add another preset box to the client mods tab

Importing presets, maybe make a way for people to paste an exported preset into the data
folder. And if the user selecets an "import" button, then we table.insert it onto their
existing list of presets in mod_presets if it doesn't already exist. This way, they won't
have to paste it directly into client_save and lose all their existing presets.

What happens if someone tries to apply a preset that contains a mod they don't have?
We can download from the workshop for them, maybe subscribe to them too?
Maybe make a warning screen saying, preset contains mods you don't have. Maybe "enable mods
you do own anyway?" confirmation screen.

Make this compatible with In-Game Mod Manager

Only display apply preset confirmation if any mods changed

the presetpopup will never start with a "currentpreset" since the mod will always startup without knowing the last applied preset

update presetid when preset name is changed?

What happens when someone tries to make a preset for client mods with the same name as an
existing preset for server mods? It will probably overwrite it and turn it into a client
mod preset.

No nil checks for presetpopupscreen inside ScrollWidgetsCtor and ApplyDataToWidget.
