the presetpopup will never start with a "currentpreset" since the mod will always startup without knowing the last applied preset

update presetid when preset name is changed?

only display apply preset confirmation if any mods changed

Importing presets, maybe make a way for people to paste an exported preset into the data
folder. And if the user selecets an "import" button, then we table.insert it onto their
existing list of presets in mod_presets if it doesn't already exist. This way, they won't
have to paste it directly into client_save and lose all their existing presets.

What happens if someone tries to apply a preset that contains a mod they don't have?
We can download from the workshop for them, maybe subscribe to them too?
Maybe make a warning screen saying, preset contains mods you don't have. Maybe "enable mods
you do own anyway?" confirmation screen.

Add another preset box to the client mods tab

Make this compatible with In-Game Mod Manager
